# Birthday Gift Webpage - Customization Guide 🎂

## What I've Updated:

### 1. **BMW Background**
   - Add a BMW car image and save it as `bmw-background.jpg` in the same folder
   - The image will be set as a fixed background with a dark overlay
   - The overlay ensures all text remains readable over the background

### 2. **Image Sections**
   - **First Section: "our moments together"** (6 images total)
     - `image1.jpg`, `image2.jpg`, `image3.jpg`
   - **Second Section: "more of us"** (additional 3 images)
     - `image4.jpg`, `image5.jpg`, `image6.jpg`
   - You can add more sections by copying the HTML pattern

### 3. **Custom Styling**
   - Birthday title now has gradient text effect
   - Enhanced colors (pink and gold theme)
   - Better text visibility against background
   - Uppercase section headers

## How to Use:

1. **Add Your Images:**
   - Replace placeholder filenames with your actual image filenames
   - Keep images in the same folder as valentine.html
   - Format: `<img src="your-image-name.jpg" alt="Description">`

2. **Add BMW Background:**
   - Place your BMW car image file as `bmw-background.jpg`
   - Or change the filename in the CSS to match your image

3. **Customize Messages:**
   - Edit the 14-day messages array in the JavaScript section
   - Change names, dates, and personalized content as needed
   - Update birthday date (currently set to February 28)

4. **Modify Colors:**
   - Pink: `#ff4f81`, `#ff7aa2`
   - Gold: `#ffb366`
   - Change these hex codes for different color schemes

## File Structure:
```
/home/prachi/Documents/sessional3webtech/
├── valentine.html (main file)
├── bmw-background.jpg (add your BMW image)
├── image1.jpg to image6.jpg (your memories)
└── CUSTOMIZE_GUIDE.md (this file)
```

## Browser Preview:
- Simply open `valentine.html` in any web browser
- Works best on desktop (responsive for mobile too)

## Tips:
- Use high-quality car images for the background
- Ensure photos are roughly the same aspect ratio for consistency
- Test the page in your browser before giving it as a gift
- You can add more image sections by duplicating the photos div and changing the section title

Enjoy! 🎁
